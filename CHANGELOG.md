# Changelog

All notable changes to knuckle are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the
project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Each
release also has a GitHub Release with auto-generated PR-level notes — this
file is the curated, human-readable history.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- The disk list flags occupied disks with their partition count, so a disk
  holding an existing installation is visible before it is selected.

### Fixed
- Disk discovery no longer hides internal disks that the kernel flags as
  removable. Flatcar's 6.6 kernel reports some SATA SSDs as removable (seen on
  a Supermicro M11SDV with a Crucial M500), which excluded a valid install
  target; the installer's own media is now identified by USB transport or an
  iso9660 filesystem instead. Disks holding an existing OS install remain
  selectable — only devices backing the running system are excluded, now
  detected through nested layouts (LVM/LUKS) as well as direct partitions.

### Internal
- Skipped disks are logged with a reason, and package-level `slog` output is
  routed to the log file rather than stderr, where it painted over the TUI.

### Added
- Flatcar Discord community links on the welcome and install-done screens
  (#117).
- `.github/release.yml` to group auto-generated release notes by label
  (Features, Bug fixes, Security, etc.) (#116).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed
- GPG verification now uses `gpg --decrypt` for Flatcar's clearsigned
  `.DIGESTS.asc` format; the previous `gpg --verify` call (detached-signature
  form) always failed silently, leaving ISO integrity unverified.
- Tailscale Ignition file and systemd unit are only injected when Tailscale is
  actually configured; prevents spurious empty entries for users who skip it
  (#343).

### Security
- Third-party CI actions (`security.yml`, `ci.yml`) pinned to full commit SHAs
  to prevent supply-chain substitution attacks (#345).

### Internal
- OSSF Scorecard workflow restricted to scheduled runs only (removes noisy
  per-push duplication) (#364).
- `kv_inject_ssh_key` VM helper eliminates the stop/mount/start cycle via
  `fw_cfg` passthrough, cutting VM-test wall time (#350).

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- `Shift+Tab` now goes back a wizard step instead of incorrectly moving the
  cursor up.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- Use `/dev/console` in the installer systemd unit so the TUI renders correctly
  when booting over serial.

### Added
- Tests for GitHub SSH key-fetch error handling and no-auth guard on
  `StepUser`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed
- Password-only auth in headless mode now propagates to `InstallConfig`.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- CNCF supply-chain stack: Syft SBOMs, cosign keyless signing, ORAS push to
  GHCR, SLSA build provenance attestations.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed
- External Ignition URL path bypasses auth/channel consistency checks.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- CI: use the correct arm64 runner label (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- `justfile`: escape Go template braces in the `vm-e2e` docker check.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- ISO: inject `knuckle` into `usr.squashfs` for reliable live boot.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-11

### Security
- Real Flatcar GPG verification via ProtonMail/go-crypto (security baseline
  B1).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- First working ISO build with GRUB and `boot-iso` justfile recipes.
